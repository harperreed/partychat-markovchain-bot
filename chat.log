i am now going to go read. tomorrow i am going into work to reinstall linux on my desktop to resurrect it. and maybe vista for halflife DM
i am getting a bit more creaky than i would like.
@polarizeme but you are correct. it is an awesome movie. after the book is consumed. i will watch the movie with my lovely wife
@polarizeme book. BOOK. watership down is an awesome BOOK. ;)
@fivekoi i have heard as much. interesting stuff. a very different style.

@w1redone no prob. it was fun.
sitting down for an excellent dinner. MUSHROOMS! MUSHROOOOOOMS!
wizehive is neat. although it looks a bit like i designed it. and that is terrible.
@zvoase yep. that is why its a bit scary.
@zvoase yea. that is a good point. but the demonstration is that i don't have to be authenticated with your twitter account to get your info
@zvoase yea yea yea. but as a hack protector it is fine.
@zvoase its gone and the hole should be patched.
@zvoase fixed maybe?
@zvoase please do

@broox mostly mosso-&gt; webfaction. but some mosso -&gt; slicehost. i wish mosso was better. its sad that it is easier to move than to use it
everytime i start something on mosso, i end up moving the site to another webhost because its easier to move the site than to work on mosso.

google thinks i am a ham radio operator. this is strange
after a vicious round of boggle. we are helping hiromi fix dinner

@micah how was the durian. tastes like onion custard methinks. smells not so onion custardy ;)
oovoo is like a bad winamp theme over skype. heh.
thus far oovoo seems like a ghetto designed version of skype with sweet video options.
why is oovoo different from every other mac app? why does it have an installer. weird
Fuck yea. Minor Threat.  http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/3131902705
@winefred it is a tradition. what else are we geeks supposed to do on a holiday? besides code, eat and watch LOTR (and listen to punk rock)
@brucery pixies are currently on. and my laziness and happiness is winning. what is your fav record?
@lillembutt  you are going to break my face
what a hard decision: Pixies records vs LOTR Marathon. I think.... hmm.. what do yall suggest?
i just built my first android app. it is just an example. but is EASY to deploy. not prob at all. not like the iphone. heh

@spooons that will be no problem... ;)
@routerguy goddamn right. Using perl automatically makes my beard grow. Its pretty weird
holy shit. my mac just talked a BUNCH. all of a sudden. scared the hell out of me. apparently rebuilding CPAN will do that on a mac. hah
@spooons now you are talking. i CAN NOT wait for that.  I actually wouldn't mind a book shaped ebook reader either - a la Diamond Age
@ShawnFumo This looks pretty awesome. http://www.foxitsoftware.com/ebook/ I am not as impressed with the audio capibilities. simple and easy
@ShawnFumo i would have to start using textmate (which is looking better everyday.. ). i am more of a VI(M) type of dude. ;)
@JennieB god no. well. maybe really really good friends. like my brother and family. they are expensive. i just want to (e)share ebooks.
@dthompson i am relegated to using svn on the cmd line. not sooooo bad. but a bit slower at the boring stuff.
@coreyweb and better. tortoise SVN is by far the best client i have used. FAR better than versions
i need more friends with kindles. i am doing all this work for just me. i need to share the love.
versions (the svn client for osx) is WAY overpriced. wtf. its like 45 bucks for a 10 dollar app i would have gladly paid 25 bucks for.
listening to pink floyd and hacking ebooks. tonight is awesome.
anyone know how to convert pdf to .mobi with good metadata?
wow. that was a rushed christmas shopping. now i am tired. haha. amazon is so tiring to use ;)
http://tinyurl.com/76sns4 this is sweet. nice work
irc is the best medium.
@showrock take it back. you like them all!
@arzie just asked "how do blizzards happen?" - apparently he was asking about the DQ delight
@Reaching4stars indeed i was. Green zebra is one of my favs. Thanks for the great food.
@Laroquod should be up now
@RobertGonzalez try now.
@Reaching4stars i liked my wife's vegan dates dish. that was awesome. The soup was also amazing and the desert was awesome too.
tonight was excellent. excellent news from friends. a good evening and a cap of a great weekend.
Green zebra is awesome. I recommend the wine pairing with the chef choice menu.
unsubscribing to an assload of feeds.
RE ebooks:  Stanza looks pretty solid for OSX.
Excited for green zebra tonight

Walking in this snow is madness. It is very slippery. Hopefully I don't die walking to work. Heh
@joestump how do you like github. i am on the fence...

getclicky img is easy to remove and still have tracking code. just annoying. i should really visit my sites more often. ;)
removing getclicky from all my sites because it displays a rather annoying graphic. lame
@benemills yea. i am a bit more wet than i normally like.
I gotta admit, I am not a huge fan of 35 degree rain
@micah probably. that dude has an "addiction"
@micah looks like it. however i don't see enough colors..
@bpm140 nerd
hiromi just turned on the apple TV and it was showing static. how does a digital media player show static? we had to reboot it. ;)
STNG was vetoed. I guess its another columbo night ;)
Hiromi and i are going to watch 1 episode of STNG. Which episode should i watch?
@chriscardinal this is very true. one of my favorites
try two with clicky. lets see how it goes. i have hope..
Listening to belle and Sebastian and eating yakisoba.
wish i could try clicky on more than one site. i can't tell if it is worth purchasing. pageview limits certainly is a bummer.

Once again I find myself venturing to work when it is dark out. Not a fan of this early morning stuff. Heh. But becoming a fan of breakfast
Milk was incredible. Please go and see it.
about to head to the theatre to check out milk. excited.
@autiomaa the thing that was disruptive is that they were talking about how CD runs are no longer the priority. Vinyl and Digital is the key
@autiomaa they were talking about how CD runs are more limited now and how vinyl is bundled with free mp3s. this is apparently mind boggling
woah. its pearl harbor day
Just saw a minor fender bender between two mercedes. Crazy drivers
Apparently it is not lady like to drink from large bottles
Listening to two friends who were in famous bands talk about disruptive digital music distribution. Interesting.
Tag is being a bitch. Hahahaha
tweet.im is interesting - however it has the same problem i had with excla.im - bunched updates
i am waiting.
@boonebgorges but its saturdya
@Kumar303 hiromi will be there. say hi
waiting to go out with some friends. steaks and drinking. a good way to beat the cold
@chiah it is really awesome. i love it. so warm. it makes living with 14 F weather bareable
wooohooo hiromi got me a hot water bottle for sleepings
it is freaking cold in my apartment. i can't imagine what it is like outside.
i just spent a LONG time cleaning up my contacts. that was rough work.
listening to crazy techno while hanging out. at some point i need to figure out what is happening today. but that point isn't now
@DomainBELL later i did ;)
my buildings dryer sucks. it isn't drying my clothes.
building a neat project ;)
@abbyshaw my wife is terrified of chickens. seriously terrified. i help her by hiding them from her. ;)
@JennieB insanely so.

every month i get to go through the william-sonoma catalog and remove all the pictures of chickens. hehe
it is cold out. excited to hang out with hiromi this evening and drink hot cider.
i LOVE listening to Warlock Pinchers.

@allspaw does it really work? I have always wondered about those programs.
@howza which is why i want a combo. Waxed canvas with a leather bottom. similar to the canvas and leather klein bag. but more satchel like.
My 3 hour nap was a good idea. Recovering from it is hard though. Hopefully it has righted my way. Oh sleep, how I miss you
@cizzlak 23andme.com - it is awesome
@azaaza i am terrible at that. i need to try it again. last time it didn't work out well. got breakfast all over. and i was asleep.
I would like a combination of a filson luggage satchel and a klein canvas tool bag. any ideas?
power.com is a good domain name. too bad the service is kind of lame.
just had breakfast. waking up early is much better AFTER breakfast.
i like how the more concave key on my das keyboard is also the next key in google reader.

I feel like I need to take our cab driver to a parking lot and teach him how to drive in snow. Like my dad did me.
After an hour of waiting for our luggage we are finally on our way home. I am happy to be almost home. I love snow
Hiromi is falling asleep standing up.
The line of people who missed flights/connections is quite long. Bummer. We are lucky we are home
Being at work early tomorrow is going to blow. I need to invent a robot harper so I can stay in bed all day.
Landing in white out snow is nuts. I have never been in a plane that had to pump it's brakes to stop. Heh. Awesome.
@brosner greeley. I come from an alternative greality.
Almost to the airport. Excited to head home. Sad to leave home.
My brother is awesome http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/3072396144
a VERY lazy day in the reed household. Hiromi and my mom are reading magazines, i am playing computer and my dad is sleeping.
I am going to miss colorado...
@mrpattIt this weekend is an unique choice. even if traffic for yall is weak - for us it isn't. messaging during this time is important.
@CampaignMonitor although this is annoying. you guys still have great support and always reply in minutes rather than hours or days. ;)
grrr @campaignmonitor. Doing maintenance during the biggest shopping weekend of the year is not the best plan.
thanksgiving weekend was awesome. nice work friends and family.

Apparently, in japan when you touch something that is too hot - you touch your ear lobes to counter act the burning in your fingertips.  Heh
